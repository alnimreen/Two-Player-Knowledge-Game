# Two-Player-Knowledge-Game

In this project we have designed and implemented a simple math game between two players using LCD, ADC converter and several I/O devices.
The heart of the system is A PIC16F877A microcontroller. The game start when start button pressed then display first question with choices for player1 and turn on his led and wait 9 seconds to answer the question ,if he choose the correct answer using switches and confirm his answers using submit button the score will increment by 10 points. Then the role switch to player2 and wait for his answers and so on. The system shouldnâ€™t display any question two times except bonus question. At end of the game the system will show the winner player depends on higher score.
